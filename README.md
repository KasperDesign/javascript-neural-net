# javascript-neural-net

Welcome to my terrible, terrible JavaScript neural network repository!

Now, you may be wondering, "why on earth would someone create a JavaScript neural network when there are already so many great options out there?" Well, my friend, let me tell you that I have absolutely no good reason. But, here we are anyway.

But, fear not, dear user! Although this project may be a terrible idea, I promise to make it worth your while. Not only will this neural network be capable of training on the MNIST dataset, but it will also feature some pretty sweet visualizations of the network in SVG. You'll be able to see the inner workings of the neural network and get insight into weightings - that's right, WEIGHTINGS!

But wait, there's more! I'm also including a user interface that will allow you to change the network structure and retrain the model. Who needs to stick to the default neural network structure when you can customize it yourself? Go ahead and throw in a few extra hidden layers for good measure, or maybe just delete them all and see what happens. The possibilities are endless!

Now, I know what you're thinking. "This all sounds great, but why on earth would I use a JavaScript neural network?" Well, my friend, that's a great question. I have no idea. But, maybe you're a JavaScript enthusiast who loves pushing the limits of what can be done in the browser. Or, maybe you just want to see if you can create a neural network using JavaScript - who am I to judge?

In any case, I'm excited to see what kind of terrible, yet amazing, projects you'll create with this repository. So go ahead and clone it, modify it, and let's see what kind of chaos we can create together!
